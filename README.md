# FundFlow
FundFlow is a pioneering senior project that solves the longstanding problem of fragmented financial management for university organizations and clubs by creating one platform that integrates funding applications with a dynamic marketplace. This solution allows organizations to maintain all their economic activities in one centralized location: tracking incoming funds, storing receipts, processing expenditures, and automatically categorizing marketplace revenue.

Creating a financial ecosystem where resources flow naturally between funding sources and spending destinations. By connecting the dots between where money comes from and where it goes, FundFlow eliminates the administrative burden of managing multiple systems, enabling university organizations to focus on their missions.
