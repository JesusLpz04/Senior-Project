# FundFlow
FundFlow is a pioneering senior project that solves the longstanding problem of fragmented financial management for university organizations and clubs by creating a unified platform that seamlessly integrates standardized funding applications with a dynamic marketplace. This comprehensive solution allows organizations to maintain all their financial activities in one centralized location: tracking incoming funds, storing receipts, processing expenditures, and automatically categorizing marketplace revenue./
Creating a transparent financial ecosystem where resources flow naturally between funding sources and spending destinations. By connecting the dots between where money comes from and where it goes, FundFlow eliminates the administrative burden of managing multiple systems, enabling university organizations to focus on their missions while maintaining complete financial clarity and accountability.
